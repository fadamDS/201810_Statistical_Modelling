#### Statistical Modelling Project Ideas

#### 1. Sampling methods for imbalanced samples

##### Idea
I would like to apply the sampling methods for imbalanced data sets discussed in class to a real data set. Further, the report will consider the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) as another option for dealing with class imbalance.

##### Which parts of the course does it rely on?
* Logistic Regression
* Quality of class predictions
* ROC and AUC
* Class imbalance
* Resampling
* Precision & recall

##### How does it go beyond class?
* Introduce another method for dealing with class imbalance in classification (SMOTE preferrably)
* Discuss the idea behind the approach
* Apply sampling methods to real data set
* Discuss resampling vs. synthetic sampling (when to use which method)
* Discuss performance, benefits and shortfalls of methods discussed in class and second approach
